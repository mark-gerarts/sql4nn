# SQL4NN

Code accompanying the paper "SQL4NN: Validation and expressive querying of
models as data".

The code consists of two parts:

- `demo-app`: a Streamlit application containing interactive examples, intended
  to demonstrate the queries to an audience.
- `notebooks`: a series of Jupyter notebooks in a more blog-like style.

Each folder contains a more detailed README.
