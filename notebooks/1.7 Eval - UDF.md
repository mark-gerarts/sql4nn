# Table as UDF input

It would be nice if we could make a user defined function (UDF) out of our eval
query. It would take as parameter a table that contains the input vectors
(columns vector index, input node index, input value), and output the eval
result.

## Postgres

We are most experienced with UDF's in Postgres, so we'll look there first.

Postgres does not support passing tables as an argument to a UDF, as mentioned
in the
[documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-implementation.html#PLPGSQL-VAR-SUBST).
There is a hacky workaround where you can pass the table name as a string, and
then use `EXECUTE` and string concatenation:

```sql
-- Source: https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/141766
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION myfn(some_table regclass)
  RETURNS SETOF dataset AS
$func$
BEGIN
RETURN QUERY EXECUTE 'SELECT * FROM ' || some_table;
END
$func$  LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This is far from ideal of course. We're better off creating a custom data type
and expecting an array of that as input. We can then use `unnest` to convert the
array into a relation.

```sql
CREATE TYPE input_values AS (
    vector_idx     INTEGER,
    input_node_idx INTEGER,
    input_value    NUMERIC
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION eval(input_vals input_values[])
RETURNS TABLE (vector_idx INTEGER, output_node_idx INTEGER, output_value NUMERIC) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY

    WITH RECURSIVE inputs AS (
        SELECT (unnested).*
        FROM unnest(inputs) AS unnested;
    )
    -- Continue with eval...
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## DuckDB

DuckDB supports [macros](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/create_macro),
which are somewhat lightweight UDFs: they only allow SELECT statements. Until
[recently](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/7299#discussioncomment-10101716),
DuckDB didn't support querying table names dynamically, but the latest nightly
build does!

```sql
-- This works on nightly.
CREATE MACRO eval(input_table) AS TABLE
    WITH RECURSIVE inputs AS (
        SELECT * FROM query_table(input_table::varchar)
    ),
    input_nodes AS (
    -- Continue with eval..
    ;

SELECT * FROM eval(my_inputs);
```
