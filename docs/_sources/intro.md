# 0. Intro

This is a series of experiments based on the paper ["Query Languages for Neural
Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10362). Our goal is to implement a number
of examples discussed in the paper to show how we can use query languages -
primarily SQL - to query neural networks.

paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14745).
