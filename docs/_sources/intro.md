# 0. Introduction

The paper ["Query Languages for Neural
Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10362) shows that, in theory, SQL can
serve as a *model query language* for neural networks. Our goal here is to see
how this works in practice through a series of examples, varying from simple
evaluation queries to more surprising applications, such as neural network
verification. For more background, view the [accompanying short
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14745).
