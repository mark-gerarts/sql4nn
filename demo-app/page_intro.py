### Validation and expressive querying of models as data

- Many different models are created during a machine learning project
- Managing datasets in a database system is standard practice, doing so for
  models is not
- It would be interesting to store models in a database and query them

Research question: can SQL serve as a **model query language**?

Our ICDT 2025 paper *Query Languages for Neural Networks* shows: **yes**, in theory.

This demo: **yes** in practice."""
